        nltk.download('wordnet', quiet=True)
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Warning: Could not download NLTK data: {e}")

def lemmatize_text(self, text):
    """Lemmatize text using NLTK."""
    if not text:
        return ""
    tokens = word_tokenize(text.lower())
    return " ".join([self.lemmatizer.lemmatize(token)

## Conclusion

The AI Movie Discovery Platform demonstrates solid engineering practices with a well-structured codebase and comprehensive testing infrastructure. While the overall project health score of 7.2/10 indicates a good foundation, there are clear opportunities for improvement, particularly in the MoviePreprocessor service and overall test coverage.

The project is production-ready for MVP deployment but would benefit from addressing the identified issues before scaling. The modular architecture and existing test infrastructure provide a strong foundation for future enhancements.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with deployment after addressing high-priority issues in MoviePreprocessor service and improving overall test coverage to 85%+.
